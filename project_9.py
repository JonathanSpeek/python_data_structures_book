# A simple software system for a library models a library as a collection of books
# and patrons. A patron can have at most three books out on loan at any given time.
# A book also has a list of patrons waiting to borrow it. Each book has a title, an
# author, a patron to whom it has been checked out, and a list of patrons waiting for
# that book to be returned. Each patron has a name and the number of books it has
# currently checked out. Develop the classes Book and Patron to model these objects.
# Think first of the interface or set of methods used with each class, and then choose
# appropriate data structures for the state of the objects. Also, write a short script to
# test these classes.
