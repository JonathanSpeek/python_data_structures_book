# The Payroll Department keeps a list of employee information for each pay period
# in a text file. The format of each line of the file is
# <last name> <hourly wage> <hours worked>
# Write a program that inputs a filename from the user and prints a report to the
# terminal of the wages paid to the employees for the given period. The report
# should be in tabular format with the appropriate header. Each line should contain
# an employeeâ€™s name, the hours worked, and the wages paid for that period.
